Super, awesome, Next
Makers of Jonas Whitney
In Sanoj we trust

Where is building 9?
Next to 33, of course!
Numbering is hard.

Falling Tetris blocks
Light up the famed Green Building
Come by, play a round!

The hazmat cafe
Is the best place to get lunch
For some BL2

A cop in a car
Eats donuts in a strange place:
Fuzz on the Great Dome

MIT’s friendly:
A TARDIS from me to you
Hello there, Caltech!

Tuition ain’t cheap
Billion dollars is a lot
To pay for school, though!

All hail the Sanoj
Sanoj our supreme leader
In Sanoj we trust

Next House is best house
Take a nice walk down Mem Drive
Next House welcomes you! :)

All schools in Cambridge
Know that one’s the very best:
And it’s MIT!

Who’s the mascot of
The MIT Engineers?
It’s Tim the Beaver!

Cryptic course numbers
Are confusing, we admit
But they’re short and sweet

Landing on the dome
The Apollo astronauts
Swing by to say hi

Want a free cannon?
We happened to grab one while
Swinging by Caltech

Free stuff on reuse!
Free t-shirts at career fairs!
Free food on free-food!

Eat at MIT:
Tasty food in dining halls
Believe it or not!

Quadcopters hover
In the skies of MIT
Panoramic shots

Painted mural walls
Line the hallways of our dorms
Unleash your artist!
