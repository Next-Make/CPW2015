Super, awesome, Next
Makers of Jonas Whitney
In Sanoj we trust

Where is building 9?
Next to 33, of course!
Numbering is hard.

Falling Tetris blocks
Light up the famed Green Building
Come by, play a round!

The hazmat cafe
Is the best place to get lunch
For some BL2

A cop in a car
Eats donuts in a strange place:
Fuzz on the Great Dome

MIT's friendly:
A TARDIS from me to you
Hello there, Caltech!

Tuition ain't cheap
Billion dollars is a lot
To pay for school, though!

All schools in Cambridge
Know that one's the very best:
And it's MIT!

Who's the mascot of
The MIT Engineers?
It's Tim the Beaver!

Cryptic course numbers
Are confusing, we admit
But they're short and sweet

Landing on the dome
The Apollo astronauts
Swing by to say hi

Want a free cannon?
We happened to grab one while
Swinging by Caltech

Free stuff on reuse!
Free t-shirts at career fairs!
Free food on free-food!

Eat at MIT:
Tasty food in dining halls
Believe it or not

Quadcopters hover
In the skies of MIT
Panoramic shots

Painted mural walls
Line the hallways of our dorms
Unleash your artist!

Psetting by day,
Touring MIT by night,
Let's go to Baker! 

Wearing tin foil...
To ward off the NSA?
Nope, just dying hair.

Delicious coffee,
How can I live without you.            - Elton <3
Grades shalt not suffer.

My grades are so great,
all of my work is finished.              -Elton <3
Oh, I just woke up.

The internet died
How could I ever go on?        -Still Elton
I have no purpose

Sunshine and rainbows
Finals done - it's party time!
I'll bring the glow sticks

It's MIThenge!
Sunlight warms the Infinite

The enemy's gate --
Which way is it? Yeah, it's down.
Lobby 7 knows.

There will be singing and dance
Also cats with hats.                        -Elton

Remember to smile!
There's a whole wide world out there,
waiting to see it.             -still Elton wow i just need a symbol or something now

Rings over Briggs Field
Bridge the gap from Simmons to
MacGregor's tower.

Wake up in the morn'
and feeling like P Diddy
Oh no i missed brunch.  - ok i need to stop (Elton)

Top of Green Building:
Bunch of weather instruments
And who knows what else?

CPW
It is a lie. Do not trust 
The weather machine

Acronyms are cool,
But are sometimes overused.
IHTFP.

Got three tests this week
Studying, nope, not for me
I'm writing a Haiku

Just finished a p-set!
Time to celebrate and - Oh.
A new one released.

Simmons has very
Confusing elevators,
So just take the stairs.

Don't take Simmons stairs
The stairs by front desk go to 
Every floor but five

I don't know you, so,
Hi Class of 2019,
It's nice to meet you!

Aerial copters
Bearing shining, silver tubes
Hello, MIT!

MIT has lots
of three letter acronyms
known as TLAs

Had an all nighter?
That means you are practicing!
many more to come

Look out your window
At a lovely river view
Or just at Simmons

Why a beaver, though?
We like them because they are
Nature's engineers

How many cool peeps
Have I met at MIT?
Too many to count.

IHTFP
Which one do I mean?
Hint: It's paradise

Athena clusters
And Pharos printing, oh my
Computers abound!

A pretty cool place

All ye need are doubloons and
A pirate's license

Seven feet of snow
An announcement: school's cancelled
Let's have snowball fights!

Where's the 13th course?
10, 11, 12, 14...
Ocean engineers

Undergrad research
Means we get to do cool things
In between classes

Scootering to class
The best way to get around
Why? Because we can.

MIT PE
Take swimming, sailing, fencing
So many choices

The career fair
Is a good place to get a
Job and a t-shirt.

See MIT's dorms:
Resident exploration
Free food everywhere!

Walk the Freedom Trail
Or go visit Faneuil Hall
So many places!

The Citgo sign glows
Above the lights of Fenway
Ah, Boston skyline

Pies fly through the air
Food fight? Nope, it's just pi day
Happy 3/14!

Everyone's looking
What's that on the Green Building?
Epic pumpkin drop

Piano falling
Off the roof of Baker House
Candy everywhere

The Stata Center:
A building of many shapes
No, it's not Simmons

Don't swim in the Charles
But if you take sailing then
Sail a Tech Dinghy!

Toss a disc or two
Frisbee is the sport to play
On Kresge Oval

The Quidditch team here
Could use a few new members
Grab your Firebolt
