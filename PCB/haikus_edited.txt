Falling Tetris blocks
Light up the famed Green Building
Come by, play a round!

A cop in a car
Eats donuts in a strange place:
Fuzz on the Great Dome

All schools in Cambridge
Know that one's the very best:
And it's MIT!

Cryptic course numbers
Are confusing, we admit
But they're short and sweet

Wearing tin foil...
To ward off the NSA?
Nope, just dying hair.

Acronyms are cool,
But are sometimes overused.
IHTFP.

MIT has lots
of three letter acronyms
known as TLAs

The Harvard Bridge is
Three sixty-four point four smoots
Plus or minus ear

The Quidditch team here
Could use a few new members
Grab your Firebolt

This is MIT
Ice cream and unicorns in
Every single class

three point one four one
five nine two six five three five
eight nine seven nine

double-oh seven.
Not James Bond. That is a class.
We like numbers here.

My rad acrostic:
In case you haven't noticed,
This spells MIT.

Yo I know pi to
a thousand places... no grills
but I still wear braces.

How many cool peeps
Have I met at MIT?
Too many to count.

Pistol, archery,
Fencing, sailing on the Charles.
You a pirate yet?

I'm five minutes late!
Oh -- just kidding, no I'm not
Thanks, MIT time

Remember to smile!
There's a whole wide world out there,
waiting to see it.

A huge wind tunnel?
A nuclear reactor?
Come see for yourself!

The Citgo sign glows
Above the lights of Fenway
Ah, Boston skyline
